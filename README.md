# Grades App
## Overview
This is a mobile application I made as a school project during my junior year of high school. I was not happy with my county's grade reporting software, as it often crashed or would not load in the student's data (forcing them to leave and re-enter the app),
so I decided to make my own app that would allow greater cutomization and work more smoothly without crashing.

## Tools
I used Expo Go to test the app on my iPhone. It was written in Javascript and used React Native.

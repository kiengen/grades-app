# Grades App
## Overview
This is a mobile application I made as a school project during my junior year of high school. I was not happy with my county's grade reporting software, as it often crashed or would not load in the student's data (forcing them to leave and re-enter the app),
so I decided to make my own app that would allow greater cutomization and work more smoothly without crashing.

## Examples
While I no longer have access to my High School student account, and thus can no longer make use of the API within the app, pictured are some screenshots from the main screens (before sign-in) of the app.

## Tools
It was written in Javascript and made use of React Native and Expo Go.
